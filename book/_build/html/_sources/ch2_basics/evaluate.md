How do we evaluate?
===================

I think this can be done in reference to the previous sound examples used for definition.

Give some quick overview of F-measure, CMLx type measures, 
as much as anything so if we use them later on they can be familiar.

* For the easy example, we can show the other kinds of outputs that would 
be counted as accurate

* And then for the more challenging ones, we can attempt to illustrate how to interpret the scores.
