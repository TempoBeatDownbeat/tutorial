Open challenges
===============

* Tracking highly expressive pieces
* Changing metres
* The main limitation of the current proposals of the BPM is that all consider relatively short-term dependencies, with focus on beat and downbeat and ignoring other interrelations at other time scales.
* Supervised models (need annotated data to train them)
* Adaptive models (pre-trained but easily adaptable to new, unseen music)
