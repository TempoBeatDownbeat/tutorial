We have included links to our [github repo](https://github.com/TempoBeatDownbeat/tutorial)
which has `requirements.txt` to set up your own environment
so that you can use these tools locally, if you so choose. To run the notebook
locally, select ".ipynb" ("Download Source File") from the downloads drop down
menu at the top right corner of the page.

If you choose to run locally, here are the recommended steps:

1) Clone the [github repo](https://github.com/TempoBeatDownbeat/tutorial) into a 
   new directory.
2) Make a new conda environment.
    - If you want to install using `pip`, activate your environment and the
  run `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Note that you should have `ffmpeg` installed
  prior to installing the requirements ([instructions here](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html)).
3) Run `jupyter lab` in your command line and navigate to the URL that it prints
  in the console  
  ([instructions here](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/starting.html)).
4) Learn!

```{note}
Especially for those participating in the live tutorial, we'll
almost surely need to iron out a few kinks in the days
immediately after we're done. So do watch out for updates
if something doesn't quite work as it should.
