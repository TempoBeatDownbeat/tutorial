# Tutorial scope and prerequisites

The scope of the material presented in the tutorial can be addressed in two ways: 
**technical** and **musical**.

From the **technical perspective** our primary focus is in providing hands-on experience
of current state of the art deep learning approaches.
To this end, we depart from historical signal processing approaches and move quickly 
from these into deep learning based approaches. 
In this way, we only touch upon the broader, multi-disciplinary context of the phenonema 
of the rhythmic and metrical structure of music and limit insights in relation to music 
cognition, computational neuroscience, and music theory. In sum, this tutorial can be 
primarily understood as a _data-driven_ approach to the estimation of tempo, beat, and downbeats from musical audio signals. 

It is important to note that this tutorial 
is **not** intended to be exhaustive in its coverage of all existing approaches, 
and furthermore places greater emphasis on more recent research covering the last
5 - 10 years. 

```{tip}
For anyone wanting a more detailed look at earlier approaches
we highly recommend the ISMIR 2006 tutorial on [Computational Rhythm Description](https://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~simond/pub/2006/ISMIR06-RhythmTutorial-GouyonDixon.pdf) conducted by not one but **two**
former ISMIR Presidents: Fabien Gouyon and Simon Dixon.  
```

From the **musical perspective** we also restrict ourselves largely to musical content 
from a Western perspective. This is in no way an attempt to diminish or downplay the 
importance of non-Western musical traditions, but rather it is a reflection of the
knowledge-base and backgrounds of the presenters. 

Concerning **prerequisites** for this tutorial, some technical expertise
in the execution of python notebooks would be beneficial, although
it should be possible just to click through all of the examples
without that. In addition, we rely on some basic informal understanding
of metrical structure in music. In structuring the content of the 
tutorial, we have strived for a fairly light-weight and non-technical
introductory part, followed by some important theoretical constructs
concerning deep learning approaches to rhythm analysis,
prior to the main "hands-on" component.
